# Manual Testing Portfolio – ToDo Application

This repository demonstrates my manual testing skills through a sample project: testing a simple ToDo application (UI + API + data validation).

## Repository Structure
- **01_requirements/** – business requirements and acceptance criteria
- **02_test_plan/** – overall test strategy and plan
- **03_test_design/** – detailed test cases (UI, API, exploratory charters, checklists)
- **04_test_data/** – prepared datasets for testing
- **05_execution_reports/** – test run reports and metrics
- **06_defects/** – bug reports with evidence (screenshots, logs)
- **07_risks_and_insights/** – risks, observations, recommendations
- **08_artifacts_extra/** – Postman collections, sample data files

## Highlights
- UI validation and error handling
- API request/response consistency
- Data correctness between frontend and backend
- Exploratory testing charters

## How to Navigate
Start with **01_requirements** to understand the scope, then follow the test plan and test design. Execution reports and defect logs show practical outcomes of the testing process.


## Final Notes

This portfolio demonstrates my ability to:
- Work from requirements and acceptance criteria.
- Design structured test cases for both UI and API.
- Prepare test data sets and execute tests systematically.
- Document defects with clear reproduction steps and evidence.
- Provide risk analysis and recommendations for improvement.
- Use supporting tools (Postman, checklists, exploratory charters) to enhance testing quality.

By reviewing this repository, you can see how I approach manual testing in a professional, organized, and detail-oriented way.
