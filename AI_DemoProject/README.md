# Manual Testing Portfolio – Reservation System

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates manual testing skills using a demo **Reservation System**.  
It includes test cases for **UI, Backend, and API**, as well as sample bug reports.  
The goal is to showcase structured testing, documentation, and defect reporting.

## Repository Structure
- **UI_Tests/** – Test cases for user interface validation  
- **Backend_Tests/** – Test cases for backend data validation  
- **API_Tests/** – Test cases for API endpoints  
- **BugReports.md** – Sample bug reports  

## Tools Used
- **Visual Studio** – Project setup and version control  
- **GitHub** – Portfolio hosting  
- **Postman** – API testing  
- **Browser DevTools** – Inspecting backend responses  


## Future Improvements
- Expand test cases to cover more edge scenarios (e.g., overlapping reservations, maximum booking limits).
- Add detailed regression checklist for quick validation after system updates.
- Include more comprehensive bug reports with screenshots and environment details.
- Document exploratory testing sessions to show additional findings beyond predefined test cases.
- Provide test execution logs to demonstrate consistency and repeatability of manual testing.
